Projects submitted 48 hours or more after the deadline will receive no credit. It's **much** better to be early than late, so start working now.\n",

    "**Checkpoint.**  For full credit on the checkpoint, you must complete the questions up to the checkpoint, **pass all _public_ autograder tests** for those sections, and submit to the Gradescope Project 1 Checkpoint assignment by **11:00pm PT on Friday, 9/22**. <span style=\"color: #BC412B\">**The checkpoint is worth 5% of your entire project grade**</span>. After you've submitted the checkpoint, you may still change your project answers before the final project deadline - only your final submission, to the \"Project 1\" assignment, will be graded for correctness.

On Gradescope, the person who submits should also designate their partner so that both of you receive credit.** Once you submit, click into your submission, and there will be an option to Add Group Member in the top right corner. You may also reference [this walkthrough video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1POtij6KECSBjCUeOC_F0Lt3ZmKN7LKIq/view?usp=sharing) on how to add partners on Gradescope.\n",

To perform a complicated table manipulation, break it up into steps, perform each step on a different line, give a new name to each result, and check that each intermediate result is what you expect.

Along that line, **DO NOT** reuse the variable names that we use when we grade your answers. For example, in Question 1 of the Global Poverty section we ask you to assign an answer to `latest`.
